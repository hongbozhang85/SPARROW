A user friendly package for ab initio chemistry reaction kinetic study.

Instructions can be found on the panels on the GUI in details.

At molecular level:
Read Gaussian output files and generate key parameters of molecules, make snapshot and movie of molecules and so on.

At reactions level:
Read ini files and generate input files of LaTeX, thermo, multiwell, densum, mesmer and mathematica to study the thermodynamics, reaction kinetics and reaction potential energy surface.

External package suggested:
Mathematica, mencoder or convert, jmol, LaTeX
